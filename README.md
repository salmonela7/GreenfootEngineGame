# GreenfootEngineGame

The game was created with Greenfoot Engine https://www.greenfoot.org/ , however it can be opened, compiled and ran on IntelliJ IDEA IDE.

A small 2D platformer game with 3 different levels, animations, jumping, shooting running mechanics.

Controls:

WASD - movement;
F - shoot;
Space - jump;

Goal of the game - run through platforms, encounter enemies, shoot and kill them. Reach the end of the level to be transported to another world.

This is the first game created by me.
Enjoy!
